# CompositePattern

<h3>***Composite Pattern has been used in Flag class.*** </h3> <br>
Flag consists of two Rectangles (body and mast) and Circle.<br>
Rectangle consists of four lines. (it is unnecessary but our teacher forced it -_- ) <br> 
If you comment out the color and the fillouts (fillOval, fill3DRect), you can see the borders as well.
