# CompositePattern

<b>Composite Pattern has been used in Flag class. </b>
Flag consists of two Rectangles (body and mast) and Circle.
Rectangle consists of four lines. (it is unnecessary but our teacher forced it -_- )  
If you comment out the color and the fillouts (fillOval, fill3DRect), you can see the borders.
